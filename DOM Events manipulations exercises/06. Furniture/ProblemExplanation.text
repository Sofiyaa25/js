You will be given some furniture as an array of objects. Each object will have a name, a price, and a decoration factor.

When the ["Generate"] button is clicked, add a new row to the table for each piece of furniture with image, name, price, and decoration factor (code example below).

When the ["Buy"] button is clicked, get all checkboxes that are marked and show in the result textbox the names of the piece of furniture that were checked, separated by a comma and single space (", ") in the following format: "Bought furniture: {furniture1}, {furniture2}â€¦".

On the next line, print the total price in the format: "Total price: {totalPrice}" (formatted to the second decimal point). Finally, print the average decoration factor in the format: "Average decoration factor: {decFactor}"
